Avionics

Lots of things to play with

Gimble half a million dollars

Desert hawk is not waterproof or weather proof

Needs direct line of sight

You can move the antenna (it's RF, specifically FM)

Autopilot

15km radius, not a restriction.  Can have antennas

Handoff ground stations

90 minutes of flight time

They wouldn't talk about price, could be $500

Parts are survivable, like they can hit the ground

Deep stall - stalls so hard it can just drop; controlled stall so they can start up if needed

IPT

autonomous, works as soon as it goes but needs to be in the air first

If they're running through a mission and lost communications, the autopilot will turn around to re-find communications.  Will orbit.

You can upload a "mission"

Forest fire analysis seems good, we have a great infrared camera built in

Max speed was 50knots, usually 30knots
Best altitude is "very high"



Top 3 items from the Tour
-Autopilot
-Infrared
-Line of sight is important, so smoke is an issue?
